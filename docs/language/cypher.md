# DGQL/language/`@cypher`

## Intro

Sometimes you may have a highly specific question, Cypher could better help you ask. Use the `@cypher` directive, in a projection, to break the flow, and execute custom cypher.

âš  Please see the [tck tests](https://github.com/danstarns/DGQL/blob/main/packages/language/tests/tck/tck-test-files/match/cypher.md) for `@cypher` usage.
